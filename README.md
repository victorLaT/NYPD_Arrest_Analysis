I have been hired by Eric Adams to use Data to find trends in Crime. The NYPD has hired  new Policemen and need to find out where to position them according to trending crime all around the city.


Data Source:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrests-Data-Historic-/8h9b-rp9u/about_data
NYCOpen data is an open source data hub that has info that particularly deals with NYC governmental operations.

This data was retrieved from NYC Open data. It lists all the arrests 2006-2023.
